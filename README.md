## Kaggle Competitions  

### 1. Titanic - solving Classification problem:  
In this challenge, we are asked to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).  
To solve this challange I'm going to use different Classification models such as - Logistic Regression, KNN, LDA and Ensmble models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).
### 2. House Prices - solving Regression problem:  
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.  
To solve this challange I'm going to use Linear Regression Models using diffrent type of approaches with Cross Validtation and different Feature Selection Models

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Sklearn.  

In the notebooks you will find the solution to each challange.
